# AI-assisted Crown Prediction - Movie Rating Project
## Week 1 - Kickoff
Goal: Build my first AI-assisted decision-making mini project within 3 weeks.
I am starting from a fundamental level in coding and applied AI work.
This repository will record every step of the process, **including failures and ugly drafts**.
## Project Idea
Use both human crowd predictions and GPT-based predictions to estimate movie ratings (e.g., IMDb or Douban)
Then compare:
- Single individual predictions
- Simple crowd average
- GPT's prediction
- A simple aggregation of crowd + GPT
to see which is closest to the actual rating.
This is my first real attempt to move from "understanding papers" to **building something that actually runs**.
